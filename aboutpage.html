<p >Hii. I'm Lesedi .
A girl with quite a lot to say.I started YouTube because my goofiness always
makes those around me laugh and my "therapist" personality always has people
coming to me for advise. That's what people should expect from my channel.
Some videos based on my : goofiness, therapeutic personality and sometimes my
daily life. </p>
<p>My instagram is just my favourite pictures out for the world to see.
mostly the first peek as to what will be uploaded on my other social media sites.
and a sneek into my random daily moments.</p>
<p>Pinterest is like my treasure chest. where i store all my inspirations,
motivation... basicaly my mood board for every aspect of my life</p>
